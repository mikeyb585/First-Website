# Hello World!
This is my first repository.

## That said (project description)
This project is a non repsonsive desktop website. This website was built on HTML5,CSS3 and Javascript. This project helped me with the basics of programming.

## Next
I will continue to learn the basics and dive in to a Javascript framework. Then I will build a responsive website using advance skills.

## Contribution
Any contribution to this project or advice in general is greatly appreciated!
